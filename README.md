"# Fcators-affecting-Donation" 

Introduction
Donation is an emotional process of helping the needy one with the excess things or objects people
have. Donation can be in the form of material things like clothes, books, etc or in the form of
monetary values like money, gold, etc. It is interesting to see how different categories of people
donates. For instance, in this project we are interested in understanding how people donates
according to their gender and age group. Specifically, how male/female and old/young donates
based on their income level.
There is a myth that females spend less money than male and people grow more generous with their
age. On the other hand, we also hear that generosity is not determined by an individual income.
One who earns a lot may not be kind enough to donate than the one whose income is less. Hence,
our motivation is to statistically observe this general belief (null hypothesis) and collect sufficient
statistical evidence to conclude against it. For this purpose, we are using different statistical methods
over our collected sample of 94 donors.
For this project we are using two categorical variable age and gender, and two quantitative variable
age and income to look for the answers of the following questions. We have used age as both
categorical variable (young and old) as well as quantitative variable (age of a person) in order to
understand the stigma of people grow more generous with their age in a better way.

Here we are performing analysis on Donar dataset and trying to find the answers of following queries through statistical analysis
Inquiries
1. Is age a categorical factor that determines how people donate?
2
2. If the answer is yes in Q.1, How does age effects the donation amount? Is the relationship
linear? Can we interpolate donation amount of other ages based on the relationship?
3. Is sex and donation amount associated?
4. Is the normal belief that female donates less true? Can we verify the result with both
parametric and non-parametric test?
5. Is there any relation among multiple (more than two) income levels and donation amount?
6. Can we evaluate a prediction equation for donation amount as a function of income, age, and
sex? How accurate is the slope of these prediction equations?
